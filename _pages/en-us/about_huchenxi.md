**Research interests**: natural language processing, optimization and controllable generation of LLMs

**Brief introduction**: 
Construct and optimize knowledge discovery models such as named entity recognition, relation classification, and temporal scoping of fact. Develop efficient and robust knowledge discovery models for few-shot and incremental scenarios. Integrate geometric and probabilistic statistical analysis to enhance the interpretability of large models, and improve the legitimacy and safety of content generated by LLMs through unlearning
