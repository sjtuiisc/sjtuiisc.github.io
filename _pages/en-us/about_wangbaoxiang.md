**Brief introduction**: 
Fine-tuning large models for specific datasets (e.g., civic data) to ensure that they can perform well in specific swarm optimization tasks; Relying on the large model, the group optimization evolution is realized through the game, and the evolutionary game theory is introduced to realize the overall optimization of the group gradually through the dynamic adjustment of individual strategies; Study of generalized relative theory and modification of gravity theory by gravitational wave observation
