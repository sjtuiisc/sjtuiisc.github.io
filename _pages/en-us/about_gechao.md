**Brief introduction**: 
To address the challenges posed by visual field defects—such as their subtle early symptoms, delayed diagnosis, and the inability of affected regions to perceive or process environmental information—this research developed a quadtree-based rapid detection algorithm for identifying areas of visual impairment. Additionally, a hazard-based scene-aware information compensation model and path planning algorithm were constructed. These innovations offer patients with visual field defects a fast and accurate integrated analysis process for detecting impaired regions, compensating for missing visual information, and generating navigation paths, thereby enabling safer and more efficient mobility in complex environments.
