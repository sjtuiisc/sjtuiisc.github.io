**Brief introduction**: Design of Autonomous Algorithm Optimization Framework for Large Models: This focuses on the NP-hard problem of multi-agent collaborative planning and scheduling. A fully automatic algorithm optimization architecture driven by large language models is constructed to achieve zero-shot operational planning (such as the knapsack problem) with autonomous algorithm generation and optimization without human intervention.
Large Model Construction in the JS Domain: In response to the requirements of scenario data isolation, game-theoretic equilibrium strategies are designed. This includes knowledge rule extraction and fine-tuning of large language models under the dual isolation of information and models. Large Model-Driven Multi-Agent Evolutionary Game: This involves strategic and tactical adversarial scenarios. Large model agents are modeled and formally described, and in-environment training strategies are designed to realize cross-domain and cross-space multi-agent evolutionary games.
