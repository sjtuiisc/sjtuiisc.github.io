**Brief introduction**: 
To meet the demands of target detection in special environments (e.g., underwater), this work designs intelligent perception solutions for multi-camera systems engaged in close-range imaging. It proposes an end-to-end image quality assessment method based on hybrid-input convolutional neural networks, constructs a physics-guided self-supervised image enhancement model, and develops a pixel-level feature descriptor tailored for low-light image stitching. A feature knowledge distillation framework is also built to enable few-shot target detection.
Building upon this foundation, the research further advances target detection algorithms for special environments (e.g., space), designing intelligent perception solutions for long-range imaging (e.g., scanning) with multi-sensor systems, involving multi-source data acquisition and fusion, as well as the detection of spatial target state information.
