<b>Brief Introduction</b></p>
<p style='margin-left:1em;'>
The Institute of Intelligent Sensing and Control at Shanghai Jiao Tong University is committed to serving the nation’s major strategic development needs. It has long been dedicated to integrating "AI+X" algorithm research with intelligent sensing and control, swarm intelligence self-play, and iterative scientific innovation. The Institute has independently developed the “Lü Shang” multimodal large model, leading the initiation and demonstration of major national scientific equipment projects and achieving a series of groundbreaking research outcomes.

The Institute currently boasts 5 senior and 5 intermediate professional staff, as well as 3 nationally recognized experts. Its team includes numerous outstanding scholars from top 20 global universities. Team members have been honored with awards such as the Shanghai Super Postdoctoral Fellowship, the Magnolia Talent Program, the Shanghai Outstanding Academic Leader Award, the Top Ten Scientific and Technological Progress Awards of Shanghai Jiao Tong University, recognition as key experts in major national in-orbit service projects, and the title of Shanghai Top Ten Outstanding Youth. Their achievements have been featured by CCTV, People's Daily, The Paper, Sina News, the official website of the Macao SAR Government, TDM (Macau), and the front page of Shanghai Jiao Tong University’s official media.

With a strong focus on fundamental research and innovation, the Institute has led and participated in over 30 research projects funded by national programs such as the National Natural Science Foundation of China, the Central Military Commission Science and Technology Committee, the Equipment Development Department, the State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense, the High-Resolution Earth Observation Program, the 863 Program, and the Beidou and Deep Space Exploration Special Projects. Through pioneering theoretical innovation and technological advancement, the Institute has surpassed one billion RMB both in research funding and capacity building, published over 100 high-level academic papers, applied for more than 30 patents, and authored two books under national publishing initiatives.

A major technological breakthrough proposed by the Institute for the first time internationally has been unanimously recognized by academicians Wang Liheng, Bao Weimin, and other experts as “at the forefront of international standards,” and has been successfully applied to five models and twelve sets of equipment in major national engineering projects. The Institute is equipped with robust experimental infrastructure and computational power to support cross-domain research, and it possesses strong technical capabilities in aerospace swarm system design and physical simulation.
